### Hi, I'm Annika! 👋

I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Proficient in C, C++, and Python. Currently dabbling in hardware as part of Midnight Sun. I'm interested in embedded at the moment, but I'm open to trying out anything!

In my free time I love taking photos and making latte art. Feel free to reach out at alogarta@uwaterloo.ca 😁
