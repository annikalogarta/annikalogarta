### Hi, I'm Annika! 👋

I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I've dabbled in firmware, PCB design, and data science, and currently I'm interested in ASIC design, RF, and signal processing. Though I am open to trying out anything related to ECE!

In my free time I love experimenting with photography mediums and making latte art. I'm actively looking for summer 2025 internships, so feel free to reach out at alogarta@uwaterloo.ca 😁
