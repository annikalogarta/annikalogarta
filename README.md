### Hi, I'm Annika! 👋

I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo, currently doing firmware at Untether AI. I'm interested in ASIC design, RF, and signal processing, but am open to trying out anything related to ECE.

In my free time I love experimenting with photography mediums and making latte art. Feel free to reach out at alogarta@uwaterloo.ca 😁
